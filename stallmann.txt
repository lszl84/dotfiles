Can't Linux be used without GNU? (#justlinux)

    Linux is used without GNU, often with other small programs, in some appliances. These small software systems are a far cry from the GNU/Linux system, and if users install one of these on their PC, they will find it rather disappointing, but they are widely used on the systems they are meant for.

    For instance, Linux can be used with the BusyBox mini-userland (we call this combination BusyBox/Linux), or in some cases with only application-specific software. It is only a small omission to refer to BusyBox/Linux as “just Linux;” however, the longer name makes a distinction that helps people understand these systems and gives credit to the developers of BusyBox.
