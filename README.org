#+TITLE: Dotfiles
#+DESCRIPTION: Configuration files for Arch Linux

* Overview

Personal dotfiles for an Arch Linux setup with XFCE.

* Contents

** bash

Shell configuration for Bash:
- Colored output for ~ls~ and ~grep~
- Minimal prompt showing current directory
- PATH additions for ~.local/bin~, VSCodium, and opencode

** emacs-easy

A clean Emacs setup optimized for usability:
- CUA keybindings (Ctrl+C/X/V/Z work as expected)
- Modus Vivendi dark theme with custom ~#212121~ background
- Minimal UI (no menu bar, toolbar, scrollbars, or mode line)
- Emacs server for fast ~emacsclient~ usage
- Better defaults: UTF-8, auto-revert, save-place, recent files

** fastfetch

System information display with a compact logo showing:
- OS, kernel, uptime, packages
- Shell, desktop environment
- CPU, GPU, memory, swap, disk
- Local IP, battery status

** ffmpeg

Handy snippets for video conversion (e.g., high-quality GIF encoding).

** gdb

GDB debugger config enabling ~debuginfod~ for automatic debug symbol downloads.

** gtksourceview

Zenburn color scheme for GTK-based text editors (gedit, Mousepad, GNOME Builder) supporting both gtksourceview-3.0 and gtksourceview-4.

** picom

X11 compositor settings:
- GLX backend with vsync
- Dual-kawase blur (strength 7)
- 90% transparency for Xfce4-terminal, Mousepad, and Emacs
- Blur applied only to those same apps

** dwm

Tiling window manager (dwm 6.5) as an alternative session alongside Cinnamon:
- Compiled from source via ~dwm-build~ with custom ~config.h~
- HiDPI (192 DPI / 2x) scaling for 3120x2080 display
- st terminal with Modus Vivendi colors
- rofi launcher, PipeWire volume keys, brightnessctl
- Rock-solid screen locking via ~xss-lock~ + ~i3lock~
- Touchegg 3-finger swipe for workspace switching
- Status bar: updates, battery, uptime, clock

** themes

GTK themes for a consistent desktop look:
- *Slot-Dark-GTK* — dark theme with GTK 2/3/4 support
- *Win12X-Fantasy-Compact* — compact theme with Cinnamon, GNOME Shell, and GTK 2/3 support
