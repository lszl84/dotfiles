# Things that would be useful but I don't know how to do:

- delete the current line when the cursor is in the middle, but with just one key, instead of using C-a C-k
- persistent minibuffer history - I quit emacs, then open it again and I need an easy way to find previously opened file with C-x C-f
- delete current word while being in the middle of it
- stuff like ci", ci'


C-x C-c - See Section 31.10 [Saving Emacs Sessions]

M-N - numeric argument
M-5 0 0 - e.g. to enter 500 hold M only for 5 and release for 0s
C-u N - numeric argument before a command
C-u - without the numeric argument, it acts like C-u 4. Can be useful

C-j - new line without indentation

M-r - reposition point to center line, top line, bottom line. Without scrolling

M-g c - go to char
M-g g - go to line

C-d - delete next char
M-d - delete next word
M-BACKSPACE - delete to the beginning of the word (not C-w like readline!)

C-k - kill to EOL. At EOL joins the next line
C-u C-k - kill four lines. Might be interesting, like d4j in vim

C-o - break line at cursor (the cursor stays)
C-x C-o - delete blank lines

C-x z - repeat command. CAN IT BE ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE DOT COMMAND???
C-x z z z ... - repeat many times

C-x o - other window
C-x o o o ... - keep switching to the other window

M-g n - next error in the compilation window
M-g p - prev error
M-g n n n ... - next error and next error etc...
